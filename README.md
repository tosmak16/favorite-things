## Deployment-Process

Favorite-things is hosted in AWS Lambda using Zappa. With Zappa, each request is given its own virtual HTTP "server" by Amazon API Gateway. AWS handles the horizontal scaling automatically, so no requests ever time out. 
The deployment process is automated as shown in yml file in the .circle CI file. A detailed deployment process is listed below.

- zappa init (To add deployment config, though this is already included in the zappa_settings.json in server folder).
- To deploy manually, run `zappa deploy dev`. 
- For subsequent deployment, simply run `zappa update dev`
- For automated deployment, setup circle CI.
- Create a pull request.
- Merge to develop when all tests have passed. An updated deployment should be triggered to deploy the app.
